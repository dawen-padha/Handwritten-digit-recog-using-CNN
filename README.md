# Handwritten-digit-recog-using-CNN
Here, in this project i have developed a machine learning model which will predict handwritten digits and the algorithm that i have used for the same is CNN(convolutional nerual network).
To run the program simply type tocolab in the main link after github , the program will open directly in google colab and for the dataset , download it from here and upload it in the colab, it will take 5 min around.
Congrats, u have successfully executed the project.
